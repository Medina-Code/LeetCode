# Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
# Example 1:

# Input: x = 121
# Output: true
# Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
# Example 2:

# Input: x = -121
# Output: false
# Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
# Example 3:

# Input: x = 10
# Output: false
# Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

# Constraints:

# -231 <= x <= 231 - 1
 
# Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
